# 🍓🍋 Strawberry Lemonade Bread

A soft, buttery quick bread inspired by strawberry lemonade — bright, tangy, and gently sweet.

---

## 🧂 Ingredients

**Dry Ingredients**

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup sugar *(reduce to ¾ cup if your strawberries are very sweet)*
* 1 ½ tsp baking powder
* ½ tsp baking soda
* ½ tsp salt
* Zest of 1 medium lemon (about 1 tbsp)

**Wet Ingredients**

* 2 large eggs, *room temperature*
* ½ cup half & half
* ⅓ cup fresh lemon juice *(approx. the juice of 2 lemons)*. Reserve 2 tbsp.
* ½ tsp vanilla extract
* ½ cup melted butter, *warm but not hot — add last*
* Juice from macerated strawberries

**Fruit**

* 2 cups frozen strawberries, thawed
* 1 tbsp sugar *(for macerating strawberries)*

**Juice Drizzle**
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 tbsp sugar

> [!TIP]
> Substituting Dairy (Half & Half Alternatives)
>
>This recipe uses **half & half** for moisture and richness, but you can substitute other dairy products depending on the texture you want:
>
>* **Heavy cream** → *Richer, slightly denser loaf.*
>  Cream has more fat, which adds tenderness and a silkier crumb. Batter may be slightly thicker, but no other adjustments are needed.
>
>* **Whole milk** → *Softer, lighter crumb; slightly less rich.*
>  Lower fat than half & half, so the bread will still be moist but not quite as velvety.
>
>* **Sour cream or full-fat yogurt** → *Super moist, tighter crumb, slightly tangy.*
>  These cultured dairy products give a tender, bakery-style texture. If using yogurt or sour cream, keep the total liquid amount the same — they can replace half & half 1:1.
>
>* **Buttermilk** → *Adds flavor depth and makes the bread fluffier.*
>  Its acidity reacts with baking soda, creating extra lift. If using buttermilk, reduce the lemon juice by 1–2 teaspoons to keep acidity balanced.
>
>In short:
>
>* **Cream = richest texture**
>* **Whole milk = lighter texture**
>* **Yogurt/Sour cream = extra tender + moist**
>* **Buttermilk = fluffiest**
>
>Use whatever fits your flavor and texture goals — the recipe is forgiving.

## 🔧 Equipment

* 9x5-inch loaf pan
* Pastry brush
* Mixing bowls
* Whisk and spatula
* Cooling rack

---

## 🔥 Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Oven and Pan

* Preheat oven to **345°F (175°C)**.
* **Brush the loaf pan with melted butter**, making sure to coat corners and edges.
* Optionally line the bottom with parchment paper for easy release.

---

### 2. Prepare the Strawberries

1. Thaw strawberries just until soft (microwave 30–45 seconds or let sit at room temperature).
2. Mash **¼ cup** into a puree — set aside for later. 
3. Chop remaining **1¾ cup** into small, blueberry-sized pieces.
4. Place chopped strawberries into a bowl and toss with **1 tbsp sugar** to macerate while you prepare the batter, or approximately 10-15 minutes.
   * This draws out a bit of juice and enhances sweetness.
5. Reserve ***up to* 2 tbsp of the strawberry juice** to add to the wet ingredients.

---

### 3. Melt the Butter

1. Melt the butter gently using a warm-water bath:
2. Place the butter dish in a bowl of hot tap water until melted and slightly warm to the touch — not hot.
3. (Tip: Set the butter out the day before so it melts faster.)

---

### 4. Mix the Dry Ingredients

In a large bowl, whisk together:

* Flour
* Sugar
* Baking powder
* Baking soda
* Salt
* Lemon zest

---

### 5. Mix the Wet Ingredients

In a separate bowl, whisk together:

* Eggs
* Half & half
* Lemon juice
* Vanilla extract
* Mashed strawberries
* Juice from macerated strawberries

Once smooth and combined, **add the melted butter last**, whisking continuously to prevent curdling.

---

### 6. Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.
Fold gently with a spatula until just combined — avoid overmixing.
Make sure there are no dry pockets of flour.

---

### 7. Add Strawberries

Add the macerated strawberries and fold gently until evenly distributed through the batter.

---

### 8. Fill the Pan

Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Tap or gently shake the pan to level and settle the batter evenly.

---

### 9. Mix the drizzle

Mix the reserved 2 tbsp lemon juice with 1 tbsp sugar and set aside.

---

### 10. Bake

Bake for **55–65 minutes**, checking at **45-50 minutes**.
Insert a toothpick into the center — if it comes out clean or with just a few crumbs, it’s ready.

### 11. Drizzle

Brush drizzle mixture over top of loaf.
Pour remainder around the edges.
Return to the oven for 5-10 minutes.

---

### 12. Cool

Remove pan from the oven and place on a cooling rack.
Let the loaf rest in the pan for **10–15 minutes**, then remove it from the pan and place it on a cooling rack.
Allow loaf to cool _**completely**_ before glazing or slicing.

---

### 13. Optional Lemon Glaze

Whisk together:

* ½ cup powdered sugar
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* ½ tsp vanilla extract *(optional)*
* 1 tsp lemon zest *(optional)*

Drizzle over the cooled bread for an extra hint of lemon.

## 💡 Notes & Tips

* Adding butter last prevents curdling and keeps the texture smooth.
* To enhance lemon flavor, add an extra 1 tsp lemon zest to the batter or glaze.
* Store covered at room temperature for up to 3 days or refrigerate for up to a week.
* Toasted slices are excellent with butter or a touch of cream cheese.
